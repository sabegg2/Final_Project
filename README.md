- Final Project
- Steph Abegg (I okayed it with James to do this project solo and use company data)

## Project Requirements

My project meets the following project requiements:

- My project is about a problem worth solving, analyzing, and visualizing. In fact, my (previous) company plans to implement the results.
- I used machine learning, since my project focuses on developing a multilinear regression model to use forecast data to model site-specific conditions.
- I used Scikit-learn for my multilinear regression.
- My project dataset contains well over 100 records.
- From the list of "you must use at least two of the following", I used:
  - Python Pandas
  - Python Matplotlib
- Since my project is based on Python anlaysis, I used sevearl other additional python packages/libraries:
  - Python datetime
  - Python numpy
  - Python math
  - Python scipy.stats
  - Python pygrib
  - Python os
  - Python requests
  - Python bs4 BeautifulSoup
  - Python tarfile
